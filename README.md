[ ![Codeship Status for scrollytelling/app](https://codeship.com/projects/7f550840-f8e9-0132-4345-3a92bb520805/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/86736)

## Getting started

```
bin/rake db:setup
```

## Background jobs

Remember you need to run background jobs to process uploads. See `Procfile`.

## Deploying a new theme

```
rails generate pageflow:theme newtheme
```

Register it:

```
# config/initializers/pageflow.rb
Pageflow.configure do
  config.themes.register(:newtheme)
end
```

Add our standards to the main theme css:

```
# app/assets/stylesheets/pageflow/themes/#{$theme-name}.css.scss
@import "./scrollytelling/standards.css.scss";
```

Then copy the Scss contents of the most recent (or a good) theme already in use. Don't use any of the CSS that was generated!

Images to be created:

```
pageflow/themes/#{$theme-name}/loading.png (150x150)
pageflow/themes/#{$theme-name}/logo_header.png (100 - 221 px wide)
pageflow/themes/#{$theme-name}/logo_header_invert.png (100 - 221 px wide)
pageflow/themes/#{$theme-name}/favicon.ico
```

Lastly change the colors in `variables.css.scss` into the colors used in the theme.

## Zencoder policies

These access policies need to be placed in the respective S3 production buckets. You will also need them in development buckets; substitute `-production` for `-development`.

### main bucket

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "ZencoderBucketPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1295042087538",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::395540211253:root"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::storyboard-pageflow-production/*"
    },
    {
