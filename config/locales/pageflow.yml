          This feature lets you add background audio to every page regardless of its page type. You can define if a sound should play only for one page or continue playing for more pages without interruption. Simply select the same atmo audio file for some adjacent pages.


          That way chapters can be seperated acoustically and pages that belong together can be weaved to a stronger unit.


          For the page type „Video“ there is a special option to pause background audio or continue at lower volume while the video is playing.


          You find the atmo settings on the „Options“ tab of each page.


          Should you ever feel distracted by the atmo audio while working on your entry, you can use the hot key „Alt + a“ to temporarily mute it. Simply press „Alt + a“ again to reactivate atmo audio.'

            Full-screen image and text


            By using the page type „Background-Image“, large pictures

            are the background for the text and are paired with a

            manually adjustable color gradient for an optimal

            legibility. In order to have an optimal presentation on

            mobile devices you can adjust the image detail to the

            display. Optionally the text color can be inverted. This

            is especially useful for bright background-images.


            Users are able to hide the color-gradient and text in

            the front-end, if they want to have a view of the

            background-image.


            Examples: Presentation, part of a picture gallery,

            portrait'
        background_video:
          menu_item: Background Video
          text: ! "# Background Video\n\n*Full-screen video played in a loop without control* \n    \nThis type of page is comparable to „Background-Image“. But\ninstead of an image, a video is shown in the\nbackground. This video starts automatically and is played\nwithout control. Thus the user cannot influence the start\nand stop of the video. Since the video is played in an\nendless-loop, it should be long enough and it should have\na proper crossover. The same applies to the soundtrack.\n\nAs a hint for the use of Scrollytelling on a smartphone: In\norder to prevent unintended data consumption, the video is\nnot played on smartphones. Instead a poster-image is\nshown, which is generated automatically. You can however\nalso choose the image yourself.\n\nExamples of application: intro, chapter cross-fade,\nambience"

            References to other pages inside a story


            In contrast to external link, you can link to pages inside

            your story. This page type helps you guide your users

            through your story.


            Examples of application: Welcome page, chapter homepage

        video:
          menu_item: Video
          text: ! "# Video\n\n*Playing a video with control*\n    \nIn contrast to „Background-Videos“ the text elements fade\nout after a few seconds, in order to draw attention to the\nvideo. With controls the user can start and pause the\nvideo or even fast-forward and rewind it. You can choose\nwhether the video should start automatically as soon as\nthe page is opened.\n\nAs an alternative to the normal text input, you can write\na description into an „Infobox“ with text.\n\nOn the „Options“ tab you can activate auto-scrolling to the next page at the end of a video. \nThis can be useful to create a seamless transition.\n\nExamples of application: Videos of all kinds, interviews,\nportraits"

          Scrollytelling processes all major media formats (photo, audio,

          video) and converts them into different formats and

          qualities. The system adapts the quality of the media to the

          internet connection and the end device of the user

          automatically. In principle the files should be uploaded in

          the optimal resolution and not be compressed beforehand. In

          order to have a well-structured work-flow, it is helpful to

          store all audio-files, background-video-loops, movies,

          pictures and texts in the required version in a separate

          file on your computer.


          ## Upload and Manage Files


          The menu item „Manage Files“ leads to the files, which have

          already been uploaded. If you click „Add more“ and „Upload“

          you can add more files.


          After you have uploaded the files, they are processed on the

          server. This can take a few minutes - especially if the

          videos are long. Click on the thumbnail of a file, in order

          to see its status. Moreover you can see the general features

          like the size of the picture or length of an audio-file and

          you can download the original file.


          The files can already be used before the process is

          finished. You can therefore continue your work during the

          loading process.


          ## Copyrights of Files


          If you click on the thumbnail of a media file (picture,

          video, audio), you can add information with regards to its

          copyright. This information is shown automatically in the

          legal notice.


          ## Reuse Files


          Videos, audio files and pictures can be used in more than

          one article. Thus, videos, for example, do not have to be

          uploaded several times. Click on „Manage Files“ and on

          „Add“/„Reuse“, to search for files in other articles and add

          them to a new one.

      meta_data:
        menu_item: Title and Options
        text: ! '# Title and Options


          ## General


          ### Title of the story


          Here you can choose a title for your story. It will be

          shown on the title bar of the browser window. It also acts

          as an indicator for search engines once the report is

          published.


          ### Language


          Decide in which language your story should be

          displayed. This refers to text which cannot be edited - like

          multimedia tips, scroll-indicators, the overview and the

          legal notice.


          ## Appearance


          ### Multimedia tips before the start


          Decide if tips or advice should be shown at the beginning of

          your story.


          ### Highlighting chapter beginnings


          This option lets the title of the first page of a chapter

          appear in a bigger font.


          ### Highlighting new pages


          At the beginning of a story an info-box shows new pages

          that were created since the last visit.


          ### Display Home-Button


          You can have a button in the navigation, which hyperlinks to

          an external website, for example back to the website from

          which you hyperlinked to the story.


          ### Navigation


          Choose between two forms of navigation: The navigation with

          a progress bar or the navigation with thumbnails. Please

          note, that due to the lack of space on mobile devices only

          the icon „Overview“ is shown.


          ## Social


          ### Social Sharing Picture


          Choose a picture, which should be shown, if your story is

          shared in social networks.


          ### Summary


          Here you can write a description, which is shown, when your

          story is shared in social networks.

'
      outline:
        menu_item: Chapters and Pages
        text: ! '# Chapters and Pages


          A story consists of at least one chapter with at least

          one page. You can create as many chapters and pages as you

          want. In order to create content, click:


          1. „New Chapter“ to create a new chapter,

          2. „New Page“ to add a page,

          3. onto the new page, in order to edit the content.


          ## Structuring Chapters


          You can structure the composition of your story with

          chapters - e.g. thematically or chronologically . The

          chapters are shown in the overview and help the users find

          their way around. It is therefore advisable to give each

          chapter a title.


          If you create an unnamed chapter, Scrollytelling acts as if there

          is no structure of chapters. The chapter and the title of

          this chapter are consequently not shown in the

          overview/navigation.'
      overview:
        menu_item: Overview
        text: ! '# Overview


          This is Scrollytelling’s editing platform. The division of the

          screen into two allows you to edit your story and see a

          preview at the same time. The editor shows modifications and

          newly selected files directly and saves them automatically.


          The sidebar can be hidden or shown. You can change the size

          of the preview-window by pulling the sidebar to the right or

          the left. If the preview-window is long and narrow like ´ a

          smartphone, you will only be able to see the „overview“ icon

          and not the entire navigation. This is due to lack of space.


          The navigation is divided into four parts:


          ## Title and Options


          Under „Title and Options“ you can set up basic appearance

          parameters as well as the title, language and legal

          notice. You can also decide which content should be

          displayed when sharing the report on social media platforms.


          For more details see: [Title and Options](#pageflow.help_entries.meta_data)


          ## Manage Files


          Under „Manage Files“ you can upload your media files, which

          you want to use in your stories. Furthermore you can reuse

          videos, photos and audio-files that have already been

          uploaded.


          For more details see: [Manage Files](#pageflow.help_entries.files)


          ## Outline


          Via the „Outline“ you can add chapters and pages - the

          actual content. Per Drag and Drop you can resort the pages

          and chapters any time.


          For more details see: [Chapter and Pages](#pageflow.help_entries.outline)'
      page_options:
        menu_item: General Page Options
        text: ! "# General Page Options\n\n### Title\n\nHere you can add the title of a particular page. This\ntitle is not only the headline of the text on the page, it\nalso functions as the title in the navigation and\noverview. If a single page is shared in social networks,\nthis title is also the title of the social media post.\n\n### Hide the title\n\nOptionally you can hide the title. Thus the title is not shown as the\nheading of the text body. For the identification of the page it\nremains visible in the navigation, overview and on social media posts.\n\n### Tagline and Subtitle\n\nHere you can optionally enter a tagline and/or a\nsubtitle. If you click on „Hide title“ the tagline and\nsubtitle are not shown either.\n\n### Text\n\nThe text-block can be formatted with the buttons underneath\nthe input field. [B= bold / I=italic / U=underlined /\ninfinity symbol= Link/URL to an external website]\n\nAll changes are visible in the left front-end-view as soon\nas you leave the appropriate input field in the editor.\n\n### Textposition\n\nDecide if the text should be shown on the left or right side.\n\n### Opacity of the gradient\n\nThe opacity of the gradient improves the legibility of\nthe text on background-videos or pictures.\n\nYou can use the slider to darken or lighten up the\nbackground until the contrast between text and background is\noptimal.\n\n### Invert colors\n\nIf you invert the colors, „bright“ and „dark“ are\ninterchanged. Thus the normally white font changes into\nblack.\n\nA general rule: Bright font for dark pictures, dark font for\nbright pictures.\n\n### Thumbnail\n\nThe thumbnail replaces the automatically generated\npreview-picture in the navigation and overview.\n\n### Display in navigation\n\nIf this option is not taken, the particular page is not\nrepresented in the navigation and therefore cannot be\nreached through it.  You can use this option if a page is\nsupposed to read more like a subpage of another page.\n\n### Transition effect\n\nThere are different scroll effects, which are visible when users enter or leave pages. You can use vertical transitions like „crossfade“ or „cut“ or „Fade to black“. Besides this you also can choose horizontal scrolling from right or left. You can determine which effect should be used for each individual page.\n\n### Fade in text after delay\n\nDefine whether text and gradient of a page should appear with a delay. \nUsers will first see the background image, then title, tagline and subtitle until finally the content text will be displayed.\n\nThere are three different durations of delay: short = 1 second, medium = 3 seconds, long = 5 seconds.\n\nThis feature fits best for intros or beginnings of chapters.\n\n### Description for the overview\n\nYou can enter a text, which appears when the user navigates\nwith the mouse over the particular page. This text matches\nwith the mouse-over-text for the page-type „Page References“\nas well as with the text, which appears when you share the\nstory in social networks."
      page_types:

        text: ! '# Page Types


          By choosing the page type, you determine what type of media

          files are used for which page. For each type of page you can

          use different settings.  For further information please

          click on a page type on the left column.

        text: ! "# Publishing\n\nClick on the „Publish“ button to publish your story. A\nstory can be published at any point in time. \n\nBesides this, there is the possibility to publish stories with \na password protection. Just activate „Protect with password“. \nScrollytelling uses the name of the account as user name and \nautomatically generates a password, which can be changed afterwords. \n\nAlready published stories can also be protected with a password by \npublishing another version - the other way round works as well. \nFor this please just click on the „Publishing“ button. The following \nsteps will then be shown and explained within the dialog window.\n\nPublished\nStories can also be unpublished manually at any time. If a\nstory has already been published, changes will not be\nshown until you publish your report again.  A story can\nonly be edited by one author at one time.\n\nThumbnail for embedding the story on external websites\nAfter publishing your story, the system generates a\nthumbnail, which can be embedded as an iframe to the\nhyperlink of another website. By means of the code, the size\nof the iframe can be adjusted. The minimum size is a height\n150px and a width of 220px."
      storylines:
        menu_item: Storylines
        text: ! "# Storylines\n\nBesides the linear narrative form from „top to bottom“, additional storylines and excursions can be used to tell further aspects of a story. For this create a new „internal link“ page and connect these links to a new storyline. Thereby you can choose at which page such a branch will lead back to the main storyline or even links to another part of a story. \n\nCreate these storylines within the „Outline“ by clicking on the plus-button next to the storyline menu. A new chapter will then be added in which you have to create the new pages of your excursion. For every storyline a „Parent page“ can be chosen, to where a user will be led, when he scrolls at the end of a storyline. Define this target page by clicking on the pen symbol.\n\n*Notice: Only the chosen storyline will be shown while editing it. Click the menu „Storyline“ to go back to the other chapters.*"
