Scrollytelling was founded by Martijn van Tol, Inge Beekmans and Joost Baaij. Martijn does content and Joost does tech. Inge, who created our logo, left the team shortly after founding.

We stand on giant German shoulders called Pageflow. Tim Fishbash is our hero.

Additional development to Scrollytelling was done by Vincent Kranendonk.
